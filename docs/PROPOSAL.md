# Noor: Written Proposal

## The Problem

Women have big dreams. Travel the world. Build six-figure careers. Achieve financial freedom. Start relationships. But there's a massive gap between inspiration and action.

They save Pinterest boards. They watch YouTube videos of solo travelers. They make vision boards. They follow creators like Gabby Beckford who've built the lives they want. But they never actually book the flight. They never send the email. They never take the first step.

The problem isn't the dream. It's the absence of structure. As James Clear writes, we don't rise to the level of our goals. We fall to the level of our systems. Women are drowning in inspiration but starving for a plan.

## The Solution: Noor

Noor is a travel agency for your life. You pick the destination (a solo trip to Iceland, a career move to Senior PM, financial freedom, a new relationship). Noor breaks it into 7 micro actions—tiny, doable steps you can complete in 5 to 20 minutes. You complete one challenge a day. You build a streak. You see your progress materialize in real time.

What makes Noor different: it combines three things. First, visualization. The app uses vision boards and travel metaphors (journeys, flights, boarding passes, passports) because neuroscience proves that visualization triggers dopamine and primes your brain for action. Second, micro habits. Instead of "get promoted," the app gives you "update your LinkedIn profile today" or "send one cold email to a PM at your dream company." Small wins compound. Third, real accountability. Streaks track consecutive days of action. Confetti celebrates wins. Your travel passport tracks both the dreams you're chasing and the real places you've actually been.

Noor turns big dreams into daily micro actions.

## Target Audience

Women 20s to 40s who want to see the world, build careers, make money, and achieve financial freedom but get stuck between inspiration and action.

More specifically: ambitious women who follow creators like Gabby Beckford. Women who are done waiting for permission or confidence. Women who know intellectually what they want to do but struggle to close the gap between knowing and doing.

Secondary audience: single mothers (like Luna's 45-year-old mom) who want more for themselves but feel overwhelmed by competing demands on their time and energy.

The app has been validated with real users: the builder's mom (45, single, overwhelmed), and her friend group (all 20s, travel obsessed, drowning in internet overwhelm). All use the app regularly.

## Why Now

Creator economy is booming. Women are increasingly ambitious and financially independent. Travel is more accessible than ever. But the gap between inspiration and action is growing wider, not smaller. There are thousands of motivational apps; there are almost no apps that actually break down big dreams into systems and micro actions that work.

Gabby Beckford's audience (1M+ across platforms) is primed for this exact product. She talks constantly about closing the gap between dreaming and doing. Her community is full of women who want big life upgrades but don't know how to start.

## Monetization Strategy

Noor Pro (powered by RevenueCat): subscription model with a 5-day free trial, cancel anytime.

**Free:** One journey (one dream) plus unlimited habits. Users experience the core product and get hooked on one dream.

**Noor Pro:** Unlimited journeys, full features, premium content (behavioral science lessons, advanced habit scheduling). Annual and monthly options.

**Pricing:** Determined in RevenueCat dashboard, tested with Gabby's audience for optimal conversion.

**Business Model Logic:**
- First journey free lowers friction to try the app
- Power users (women pursuing multiple dreams simultaneously) upgrade to Pro
- Subscription is recurring revenue, not one time
- RevenueCat handles all IAP logic, sandbox testing, and restore purchases
- Remote paywall allows A/B testing and pricing iteration without app resubmission

**Unit Economics:**
- $20k hackathon prize funds initial development and launch
- RevenueCat Pro subscription (conservative estimate: 5-10% of active users at $10/month) generates recurring revenue
- Long-term: community features, partnerships with travel brands, sponsored habit templates

## Why This Wins

**Audience Fit:** Built for women who already follow creators like Gabby. The language, metaphors (travel agency, boarding passes), and problem statement all match her community's needs and mindset.

**Technical Quality:** Built in SwiftUI with SwiftData, Claude API integration for personalized itinerary generation, RevenueCat monetization. TestFlight ready.

**Differentiation:** Not another to-do list or motivational app. Combines visualization science, micro habits, streak gamification, and real travel tracking in one product. Clear "travel agency for your life" angle.

**Validation:** Real users (builder's mom, friend group) already using it. Proof of product-market fit before launch.

**Revenue Potential:** Subscription model with high creator audience overlap. Recurring revenue. $20k prize + community of 1M+ primed for adoption.

## The Builder

Luna is 22, a chemistry major obsessed with neuroscience who paused her final year of college to move to San Francisco and learn mobile app development. She built Noor to solve a problem she lives and that her mom lives. She's proof that you don't need permission to build the life you want. You need a plan.
