# Noor: Written Proposal

## The Problem

Women have big dreams. Travel the world. Build six-figure careers. Achieve financial freedom. Start relationships. But there's a massive gap between inspiration and action.

They save Pinterest boards. They watch YouTube videos of solo travelers. They make vision boards. They follow creators like Gabby Beckford who've built the lives they want. But they never actually book the flight. They never send the email. They never take the first step.

The problem isn't the dream. It's the absence of structure. As James Clear writes, we don't rise to the level of our goals. We fall to the level of our systems. Women are drowning in inspiration but starving for a plan.

## The Solution: Noor

Noor is a travel agency for your life. You pick the destination (a solo trip to Iceland, a career move to Senior PM, financial freedom, a new relationship). Noor breaks it into 7 micro actions—tiny, doable steps you can complete in 5 to 20 minutes. You complete one challenge a day. You build a streak. You see your progress materialize in real time.

What makes Noor different: it combines three things. First, visualization. The app uses vision boards and travel metaphors (journeys, flights, boarding passes, passports) because neuroscience proves that visualization triggers dopamine and primes your brain for action. Second, micro habits. Instead of "get promoted," the app gives you "update your LinkedIn profile today" or "send one cold email to a PM at your dream company." Small wins compound. Third, real accountability. Streaks track consecutive days of action. Confetti celebrates wins. Your travel passport tracks both the dreams you're chasing and the real places you've actually been.

Noor turns big dreams into daily micro actions.

## Target Audience

Women 20s to 40s who want to see the world, build careers, make money, and achieve financial freedom but get stuck between inspiration and action.

More specifically: ambitious women who follow creators like Gabby Beckford. Women who are done waiting for permission or confidence. Women who know intellectually what they want to do but struggle to close the gap between knowing and doing.

Secondary audience: single mothers (like Luna's 45-year-old mom) who want more for themselves but feel overwhelmed by competing demands on their time and energy.

The app has been validated with real users: the builder's mom (45, single, overwhelmed), and her friend group (all 20s, travel obsessed, drowning in internet overwhelm). All use the app regularly.

## Why Now

Creator economy is booming. Women are increasingly ambitious and financially independent. Travel is more accessible than ever. But the gap between inspiration and action is growing wider, not smaller. There are thousands of motivational apps; there are almost no apps that actually break down big dreams into systems and micro actions that work.

Gabby Beckford's audience (1M+ across platforms) is primed for this exact product. She talks constantly about closing the gap between dreaming and doing. Her community is full of women who want big life upgrades but don't know how to start.

## Monetization Strategy

**Noor Pro (powered by RevenueCat):** Subscription model with 7-day free trial, cancel anytime via Apple Account.

**Free Tier:** One journey (one dream) plus unlimited habits. Users experience the core product and validate product-market fit on a single goal before deciding to expand.

**Noor Pro:** Unlimited journeys, full features, premium content (behavioral science lessons, advanced habit scheduling). 
- **Annual:** $39.99/year (7-day free trial included)
- **Monthly:** $14.99/month (immediate payment, no trial)

**Why This Pricing Works:**
The 7-day free trial increases conversion rates by letting users experience the full product before commitment. During the trial, users progress through onboarding, complete the tutorial, and get a personalized feel for the app—creating genuine product affinity before the paywall appears. By then, they're invested and excited. The annual option is strategically positioned as the primary offering: at $3.33/month, it's substantially cheaper than the $14.99 monthly, incentivizing longer-term commitment and reducing churn. This improves business fundamentals—annual subscriptions provide predictable revenue and better LTV metrics for scaling.

**Business Model Logic:**
- First journey free lowers friction to try the app
- Power users (women pursuing multiple dreams simultaneously) upgrade to Pro
- Subscription generates recurring revenue, not one-time purchases
- RevenueCat handles all IAP logic, sandbox testing, and subscription restoration
- Remote paywall enables real-time A/B testing and pricing iteration without app resubmission
- Users can gift 30 days of Noor Pro free to friends, creating organic growth loops beyond initial distribution

**Market Validation:**
Launching with content creator Gabby Beckford's engaged fanbase ($1M+ audience of ambitious women 20-40) provides initial traction, but the real addressable market is larger. Competitive analysis of proven market leaders—Fabulous, Habitica, Flighty—reveals that this demographic has proven demand. These apps collectively generate over $10M MRR. Noor's differentiation (merged feature set from top performers, clean UI, age-appropriate gamification, travel aesthetic) targets this underserved intersection. Real usage from Luna's peer network confirms product-market fit before launch.

**Unit Economics:**
- $20k hackathon prize funds development and launch
- Conservative estimate: 5-10% conversion to Pro at $39.99/year average
- Recurring subscription revenue compounds with user growth
- Long-term: community features, partnerships with travel brands, sponsored habit templates

## Why This Wins

**Audience Fit:** Built for women who already follow Gabby. The language, metaphors (travel agency, boarding passes), and entire problem statement match her community's needs and mindset. Day one has a warm audience ready to try.

**Technical Quality:** SwiftUI + SwiftData backend with Claude API integration for personalized itinerary generation. RevenueCat handles monetization infrastructure. App is TestFlight-ready and production-grade.

**Clear Differentiation:** Not another to-do list or motivational app. Combines visualization science, micro-habit mechanics, streak gamification, and real travel tracking in one cohesive product. The "travel agency for your entire life" positioning is both memorable and actionable.

**Proven Validation:** Real users (including Luna's mom and friend group) are already using and engaging with the product. This isn't theoretical—product-market fit is validated before launch.

**Revenue + Growth Potential:** Subscription model with direct creator distribution to a primed, high-overlap audience. Recurring revenue model scales with user base. The $20k prize combined with Gabby's 1M+ community creates a launch advantage most hackathon projects don't have. 

## The Builder

Luna is 22, a chemistry major obsessed with neuroscience who paused her final year of college to move to San Francisco and learn mobile app development. She built Noor to solve a problem she lives and that her mom lives. She's proof that you don't need permission to build the life you want. You need a plan.
